<div align="center"><H1> Smart Traffic Light System (ASIC)</H1></div>
Design flow of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) that implements a smart traffic light system aiming to minimize wait time for all drivers while minimizing accident risk.

## Purpose

This is a university project for the ECE413s-ASIC Design and Automation course at Ain Shams university, this project aims to strengthen the student's design abilities as well as verification and troubleshooting skills.

The project goes through various phases till completion:
* **System Design:**      Deciding system's main functionality and constraints, constituents modules and their interfacing, the thought process behind the decisions.
  
* **Light Algorithm:**    Flowchart and pseudocode for the designed algorithm for the traffic lights that allows for minimum accident risk and maximum traffic time utilization.

* **Controller Specs:**   Planning the architecture and logic of the traffic controller and how it interfaces with the traffic lights to give them orders.

* **FSM Design:**         Creating schematic and state table for the finalized state machine that enables our traffic lights using inputs from the controller.

* **Simulation:**         The Verilog code for the design with the synthesis schematic of the RTL code, as well as snapshots of the waveform diagrams.

* **Test Bench:**         The verification test written for the design to check correct functionality and provide the proposed test strategy to ensure all cases are tested.

## Disclaimer

It's important to note that this implementation may not follow all best practices and may not be the most efficient or optimal solution. As an educational project, We relied on our own creativity and problem-solving skills to overcome hurdles along the way. While the IC is functional and capable of doing its task, there is always room for improvement in terms of performance, efficiency, and design.
